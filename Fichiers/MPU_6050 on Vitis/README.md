In our 4th year Robotics course, we had to use an inertial unit in a project. We naturally chose Vitis and the aim of the course is to display a cube representing Vitis moving in 3 dimensions. 

We used Arduino and Processing to display the cubes in 3D. 
There are 3 different codes, the first only with an accelerometer, the second only with a gyrometer and the last with both.

Finally, there's a bonus Arduino code for a remote control that controls the robot with the remote control's Roll and Pitch angles (Android smartphone only).
